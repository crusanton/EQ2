The goal of EQ2 package is to import data from the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration which includes several thousands of years of
earthquake data from around the world.

- Read in data and clean it up with eq_clean_data and eq_location_clean
- Create a geom for plotting a time line of earthquakes within a range
  of dates
- Create geom_timeline_label for adding annotations to the earthquake
  data
- Create an interactive map with eq_map
- Create an HTML label to annotate text in the interactive (leaflet) map
