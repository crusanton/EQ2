The goal of EQ2 package is to import data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration which includes several thousands of years of earthquake data from around the world.

* Read in data and clean it up with eq_clean_data and eq_location_clean
* Create a geom for plotting a time line of earthquakes within a range of dates
* Create geom_timeline_label for adding annotations to the earthquake data
* Create an interactive map with eq_map
* Create an HTML label to annotate text in the interactive (leaflet) map
